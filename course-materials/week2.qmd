## Overview

During Week 2, we will talk about ethics in linguistic research, covering the following topics:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## 1. Outstanding questions
**What is language, and *where* is language?**

- What are the consequences of these answers when designing a linguistic survey?
- How do our assumptions about "where language lives" change how we ask questions?

## 2. Ethical Practices
**What are ethical (or *respectful*) practices?**

- We will define what it means to be ethical in linguistic surveys (and any other kind of survey).
- I will share **real examples** of ethical dilemmas and situations that I encountered in the past few years, and how to avoid such problems.

## 3. Institutions
**What are the institutional structures for research ethics in Taiwan?**

- We will focus on the **Center for Taiwan Academic Research Ethics Education** (in Chinese: 臺灣學術倫理教育資源中心) provided by the Ministry of Education.
- I will show you why you should care about these regulations, even as undergraduate and graduate students.
